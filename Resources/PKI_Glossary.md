# PKI Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for key terms related to Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).
## A

- **Asymmetric Cryptography**: A cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys: public keys (which may be known to others) and private keys (which may never be known by any except the owner).

## B
- **Biometric Authentication**: A security process that relies on the unique biological characteristics of an individual to verify their identity.

## C

- **Certificate**: An electronic document that uses a digital signature to bind a public key with an identity.

- **Certificate Authority (CA)**: An entity that issues digital certificates.

## C
- **Certificate Revocation List (CRL)**: A list of digital certificates that have been revoked by the issuing Certificate Authority before their scheduled expiration date.

## D

- **Digital Signature**: A mathematical scheme for verifying the authenticity of digital messages or documents.

## E
- **Encryption**: The process of converting information or data into a code to prevent unauthorized access.

## H
- **Hash Function**: A function that converts an input of arbitrary length into an output of fixed size.

## K
- **Key Pair**: In asymmetric cryptography, a pair of keys consisting of a public key and its corresponding private key.

## N
- **Non-repudiation**: The assurance that someone cannot deny the validity of something. In cryptography, it refers to a service that provides proof of the integrity and origin of data.

## O
- **Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)**: An Internet protocol used for obtaining the revocation status of an X.509 digital certificate.

## P

- **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**: A set of roles, policies, hardware, software and procedures needed to create, manage, distribute, use, store and revoke digital certificates and manage public-key encryption.

## P
- **Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS)**: A group of public-key cryptography standards devised and published by RSA Security LLC.

## R

- **Root Certificate**: A self-signed certificate issued by a root certificate authority (CA).

## S
- **SSL/TLS**: Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security, cryptographic protocols designed to provide communications security over a computer network.

## T
- **Trust Store**: A repository of trusted root certificates used by a program to verify digital certificates.
## X

- **X.509**: A standard defining the format of public key certificates.
